# react-native-google-drive-api-wrapper-js

This repo is a fork of [RobinBobin/react-native-google-drive-api-wrapper](https://github.com/RobinBobin/react-native-google-drive-api-wrapper) and provides pure JavaScript source files and TypeScript declaration files instead of the TypeScript source files provided by the original package. This prevents type errors.

To install it, run:

```sh
npm install react-native-google-drive-api-wrapper-js
# or
yarn add react-native-google-drive-api-wrapper-js
```

FOr documentation of the actual package, please consult the repo linked above.
